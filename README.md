# Schedule Countdown

A utility for keeping track of schedules.

Are you struggling to remember or keep track of your daily or weekly schedule? Then Schedule Countdown is for you!

With Schedule Countdown, it's easy to keep track of whatever schedule you have! You can create a schedule in the Schedule Editor and import and export schedules as JSON for saving and loading! Then, you can count down every second until important events, such as the start of a break! It also features dark and light themes to match your aesthetic!

## How to use

This section will detail how to use Schedule Countdown by detailing each part of the utility.

### Schedule Management menu

When you first start up the utility you will be greeted with the schedule management menu. Here you can import a previously-created schedule, export the current schedule as JSON to your downloads, and add your first event. When you add an event, you will be asked its name, the time it occurs, and whether it is an instantaneous event, the start of an event, or the end of an event. Once you add an event, you can view, edit, and delete it. Adding more events will result in all events being automatically sorted chronologically! Selecting "Clear Schedule" will result in the removal of all events in the current schedule.

### Main view

The main view displays the time in green, the time since the previous event in red, and the time until the next event in blue (cyan in the dark theme). All three are appropriately sized to prioritize commonly-used information!

### Menu

The menu can be opened by clicking on the button in the top right corner. You can then return to the schedule management menu, change the theme between light and dark using a dropdown menu, and access the "About" dialog.

## Why Schedule Countdown?

I use this utility practically *every day* at my school, and my peers have been *begging* for access! Some of them use an app on their cellphones which does practically the same thing, but Schedule Countdown is different. Why? Because you can access it right on your school computer, making it a practical option even when cell phones are prohibited! Plus, the streamlined UI puts your most crucial information front and center!
